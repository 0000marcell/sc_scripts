implement the basic front-end login logout logic based on $ghp/ember-test
  being implemented on em.rb generate login
  need to install the dependencies and configure both
    ember-cli-mirage
    ember-simple-auth
make login, signup logic based on the new sandbox/javascript/ember/ember-rails
create password-reset route and logic when creating the login logic
ignore materialize, create a default login, logout etc.. without
  caring about views and appearence
implement destroy login
testing implemented login logic
bug when installing materialize, ruby eats the output of materialize
  learn how to avoid this, maybe using pop3
implement ember mirage to suport login logic 
  install mirage
  create configuration for signup login new users etc...
try to implement the login logic using component and routes only
  implement the component using default materialize stuff
  the component must be a black box, actions are passed down
  to the component, and handled in the route.
create sepate session component and upload to npm, and
just intalled it in new version of the program
create landing page using materialize
  wait for the docs or read the component and workout how to use v1
implement deploy to s3
transform program to desktop version
transform program to mobile version

done:
first create a defalt ember app with all the dependencies:
creating new login logic on ember-test
implement login logic
need to install esa
install v1 materialize  with em materialize
copy installed node and bower instead of having to download again
change specific information on ember-cli-build and package.json
create a default ember program
